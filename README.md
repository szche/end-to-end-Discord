# End-to-End encryption in Discord

## 🔒Cryptography

Key exchange between two parties is realized using Diffie-Hellman protocol. After the secret key has been determined, all text messages are encrypted using AES. 
If you want a real private messaging service, use [Signal](https://signal.org/) instead.

## ✅What works and what doesn't
Currently this supports text encryption in direct messages only.
